Complete the function header by supplying the parameter for the dataframe 
df and the flexible argument *args.

Complete the for loop within the function definition so that 
the loop occurs over the tuple args.

Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the
 column name 'lang'. Assign the result to result1.

Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the
 column names 'lang' and 'source'. Assign the result to result2
